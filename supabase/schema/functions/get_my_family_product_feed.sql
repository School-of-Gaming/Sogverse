COMMENT ON FUNCTION public.get_my_family_product_feed(p_participation_id uuid) IS 'One round trip for a family club/camp/event page, scoped to ONE participation: the product shell, the group name and its family-facing note, the venue on in-person products, the teaching gedus'' first names, the group''s full stored session history with reports and PHOTOS, the named participant''s own attendance marks, and that participant''s own creations. Each session carries updated_by and the last editor''s first name — last editor of the SESSION, not author of the report: an attendance mark or a staff-note edit moves it. The name travels per session because a past session''s editor may no longer teach the group. Each session also carries `images`: {id, width, height} per photo, ordered by (created_at, id), the same shape the gedu and admin documents carry because one shared gallery renders all three, and never the uploader, which is safeguarding audit. That key rides on this strict family document under no versioned twin of its own, on the severity paragraph in docs/plans/CLAUDE.md: transient read-side breakage inside a release window is accepted. `creations` is a TOP-LEVEL array of {title, url} — this participant''s own, in this group, and structurally incapable of holding anybody else''s because it is not a map keyed by participant. It is the one staff-authored family-facing field that carries links, an owner-approved exception to the link-free rule session reports follow, and the render side parses each URL and degrades to the title as plain text when it is not http(s). Empty array when there is nothing, so the card renders on emptiness and never on null. Self-scoping — the caller must be the participation''s participant (a child, or a parent holding a seat of their own) or a parent linked to them; an unplaced participation has no page and answers P0002; a row that does not exist and a row belonging to another family are refused identically, so it cannot be used as an oracle for enrollment ids. Carries no gedu note of any scope, no roster, no other participant''s marks or creations, no parent email, no material link, no requires_gamer_creations flag and no owed/completeness state.';
