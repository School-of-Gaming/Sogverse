-- 00173: a product has an AUDIENCE, and a seat may be the parent's own.
--
-- 00172 renamed the seat's occupant column without changing a single rule.
-- This is the migration that changes the rules.
--
-- WHAT CHANGES
--
--   1. `products` gains `for_gamers` (default true) and `for_parents` (default
--      false), with a CHECK that at least one is on. Every existing row
--      backfills to gamers-only through the defaults, so nothing that exists
--      today changes meaning.
--   2. `min_age` / `max_age` become NULLABLE, tied to the audience by CHECK:
--      both present when `for_gamers`, both absent when not. Age is a property
--      of the gamer audience and of nothing else — there is deliberately no
--      "18+" sentinel for an adult product (see the plan's rejected
--      alternatives).
--   3. `chk_participations_no_self_signup` is dropped. It is the single
--      structural blocker for a parent occupying a seat, and its protective
--      intent — a payer cannot casually take a child's seat — survives as the
--      RPC gates below rather than as a table constraint.
--   4. The PRE-MONEY enrollment RPCs become audience-aware:
--      `create_participation`, `join_waitlist`, `admin_enroll_gamer`.
--   5. The three roster RPCs emit the participant's OWN email for adult seats.
--   6. `create_product` / `update_product` carry the two flags.
--
-- WHAT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT CHANGE
--
--   * `confirm_paid_participation` gets NO audience gate. It is the
--     after-money recorder: service-role-only, reachable only through the
--     signature-verified Stripe webhook, fed metadata our own server wrote
--     *after* `create_participation` validated the same tuple. A gate there
--     defends against no attacker who is not already holding the webhook
--     secret or the server, and it creates a failure mode with money in it: an
--     admin unticking an audience flag between checkout and webhook would make
--     the webhook refuse forever — charge stands, no seat, refunds manual.
--     Accepted trade: in that same race a seat lands on a product whose
--     audience changed seconds earlier, which an admin handles like any other
--     roster question. Validate before money; trust and record after.
--   * `join_product_waitlist`. Its whole body is `assert_role('customer')` plus
--     a delegation to `join_waitlist` with the customer pinned to `auth.uid()`,
--     so "participant = customer" is decidable only in the engine, and that is
--     where the gate goes. A second copy in the wrapper would be a duplicate of
--     a predicate it cannot express any better.
--   * `leave_my_waitlist_spot` — already keyed on `customer_id`, which is the
--     parent's own id on a self seat.
--   * The RPC result JSON keys spelled `gamer_id` / `gamer_*`, and the
--     `admin_enroll_gamer` function name. Those rename with the roster step,
--     not here. The ONE new key added below is spelled `participant_email`,
--     because it is a field about whoever holds the seat and naming a new
--     field for the noun being retired would be inventing debt.
--
-- HOW "SELF" IS EXPRESSED, PER FUNCTION. There is no single answer, because
-- these functions do not share an auth model:
--
--   * `create_participation` is service-role-only and has no `auth.uid()`. The
--     expressible invariant is `p_participant_id = p_customer_id`, with the
--     calling route pinning `p_customer_id` to the session user — exactly as it
--     already did to make the parent-link check mean anything.
--   * `join_waitlist` is the same: no grants at all, reached only from
--     `join_product_waitlist`, which pins the customer to `auth.uid()`.
--   * `admin_enroll_gamer` takes no customer at all — it derives one. So "self"
--     is decided from the participant's ROLE: a `customer` profile is an adult
--     buying nothing and paying for their own seat (customer = participant);
--     anything else resolves a customer through the parent link as before.
--
-- Signatures are unchanged on every function except the two product writers, so
-- `CREATE OR REPLACE` keeps their ACLs and COMMENTs. The grants are re-issued
-- anyway, and that is not decoration: 00172 proved on staging that a function
-- coming out of `db push` can carry `=X/postgres` regardless of the default
-- privilege entry `00099` set, and the assertion at the foot of this file
-- fails if any of them came back anon-executable.

Every participation object carries the same fields, including the two the panel''s refusal dialogs are keyed to: has_live_subscription (a real read on ALL THREE branches since 00170 — a LEFT JOIN to family_subscriptions excluding status ''cancelled'', so it means live rather than ever-existed) and has_payment_marker (a real read of stripe_checkout_session_id — money once arrived for this seat, which demotion does not clear). Both are resolved here so the panel decides a drag from one snapshot rather than asking per chip. Since 00173 each object also carries participant_email: the adult''s own address on a self seat, NULL on a child row, where gamer_parent_first_name/last_name name the contact instead.';

-- 6. The product writers carry the audience.
--
-- Both are DROPPED and recreated rather than replaced: the two flags are added
-- as NON-DEFAULTED parameters, which changes the argument list, and a DEFAULTED
-- parameter would have been the wrong shape twice over — PostgREST cannot
-- disambiguate the overload it would create, and an omitting caller would
-- silently reset a product's audience instead of failing. Every caller breaks
-- loudly, which is the point.
--
-- `p_min_age` / `p_max_age` move to the DEFAULT NULL tail in the same breath.
-- They have to accept NULL now, and a non-defaulted parameter cannot express
-- "absent" through the generated TypeScript argument type at all (codegen types
-- a required argument as non-nullable), so leaving them where they were would
-- wall the admin form off from ever sending a parents-only product. What makes
-- a defaulted age safe here — and a defaulted audience flag unsafe — is
-- chk_products_ages_iff_for_gamers: an omitted age on a for_gamers product is a
-- CHECK violation, not silent data loss. There is no equivalent guard for the
-- flags, which is exactly why they are not defaulted.

Since 00171 it also DELETES the product''s waitlist whenever the saved waitlist_enabled is false — the flag goes off by unticking it or by uncapping, and the groups panel draws its waitlist column only while it is on, so a surviving queue would be invisible to every affordance that could work it. Deletion rather than promotion: promoting would grant seats with no subscription behind them, while the edit itself opens seats, so a dropped family can simply sign up again. It is silent by owner decision — no confirmation, warning or email — and keyed to the flag''s value rather than to it changing, so it also heals a queue stranded before the rule existed. One exception: a waitlisted row carrying a LIVE subscription (a family_subscriptions row with status <> ''cancelled'', 00170''s predicate) is skipped, because the FK cascades and deleting it would orphan billing Stripe still runs. SECURITY DEFINER since 00171 — participations grants authenticated no writes, so the delete cannot run as the caller; the assert_admin() first statement is what authorizes the whole function. Since 00173 it assigns for_gamers/for_parents, which are non-defaulted parameters precisely because this statement assigns every editable column on every call.';

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 7. End-state assertions.
--
-- Two things this migration could get wrong silently, so both are proved before
-- it commits:
--
--   (a) A recreated function comes back PUBLIC-executable. 00099's
--       ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES reads like it prevents this and does not — the
--       entry does not govern the session `supabase db push` applies migrations
--       in, which is how 00172 briefly left service-role-only paid-seat writers
--       callable by `anon` on staging until the REVOKEs were added. Asserted
--       here rather than left to the access-control test, because that test
--       runs only in CI and this migration also runs against hosted databases.
--
--   (b) A CHECK constraint that exists but does not bite. Existence by name is
--       cheap to assert and proves almost nothing, so the constraints are
--       exercised against real rows — in a TEMP copy of `products` built with
--       `LIKE ... INCLUDING CONSTRAINTS`, which carries the CHECKs but neither
--       the foreign keys nor the triggers. That is what makes the probe safe on
--       a database with real data: it writes nothing to `public.products`, and
--       needs no `created_by` profile to exist.
