-- The dashboard counts an addressable gamer again.
--
-- 00235 taught the admin dashboard's users strip that a gamer can hold a real
-- mailbox: its `verified` tile stopped keying on the ROLE and started keying on
-- the ADDRESS, so a gamer whose parent chose sign-in mode `email` counts like
-- everyone else, and the tile reports NULL only for a role none of whose
-- accounts holds an address a human reads.
--
-- 00237 then removed the holiday calendar and restated get_admin_dashboard() in
-- place — from a body that predated 00235. It sorts after 00235, so its version
-- wins: on any database built from `migrations/` the strip is back to
-- `CASE WHEN r.role_name = 'gamer' THEN NULL`, and an email-mode gamer who has
-- verified their address is invisible in the one place an admin would look to
-- see that the feature is working. Neither migration is wrong on its own; they
-- were written on branches that did not yet know about each other, and this is
-- the fix-up that reconciles them.
--
-- WHAT THIS RESTATES
--
-- 00237's body, verbatim, with 00235's users strip spliced back in — the
-- `addressable` filter, the `gamer_profiles` join it reads `sign_in` from, and
-- the `verified` CASE that reports NULL only when a role has accounts and none
-- of them is addressable. Nothing 00237 removed comes back: no holiday window,
-- no holiday LATERAL, no `holidays` key in the emitted schedule object.
--
-- The signature is unchanged, so this replaces in place and keeps its ACL; the
-- REVOKE/GRANTs are restated below anyway so the file states the end state it
-- leaves, and the COMMENT is restated with 00235's stat clause restored.

  -- 1. The users strip: one tile per role, always all of them.
  --
  -- Driven by `enum_range` rather than by what `profiles` happens to contain, so
  -- a role with no accounts renders a zero tile instead of vanishing — and a
  -- role added to the enum later arrives here without an edit.
  --
  -- Two stats can be NULL rather than 0, and the difference is the point.
  -- `verified` is NULL for a role none of whose accounts holds a REAL address: a
  -- gamer in sign-in mode `parent` or `username` carries a synthetic
  -- @gamer.sogverse.internal handle nobody will ever click a link in, so "0
  -- verified" would report a problem that does not exist. A gamer in mode
  -- `email` holds a real mailbox and counts exactly like everyone else — which
  -- is why the test below is the ADDRESS and not the role (00235). `certified`
  -- is the same NULL-means-no-meaning shape for a simpler reason: only an
  -- educator can be certified.
  --
  -- A role with no accounts at all still reports 0 rather than NULL — the
  -- addressable test only speaks about accounts that exist, and an empty tile
  -- has nothing to say either way.

  -- putting a broken account in a queue whose only action (certify) writes to the
  -- row that is not there. Missing means excluded; the queue is for accounts that
  -- exist and are waiting.
  --
  -- `contract_accepted_at` (00201) is the candidate's standing against the
  -- CURRENT contract version, or NULL. It informs the certification decision and
  -- does not gate it — an unsigned candidate is still certifiable, and the admin
  -- is the one who decides what to make of the gap.
  --
  -- Standing is judged on the BASE version (00202): a version string is
  -- `<base>/<language>` and the languages of one version are the same agreement,
  -- so signing either makes a candidate current. min() because a candidate may
  -- hold both languages' rows — the first signature is the moment they agreed,
  -- and a scalar subquery would error rather than answer.
  --
  -- `criminal_record_check_at` (00213) is when an admin recorded seeing this
  -- candidate's criminal record extract, or NULL if none has been recorded. The
  -- flag beside it is deliberately not shipped: the stamp is non-NULL exactly
  -- when the flag is true, so a second field could only ever contradict the
  -- first. It informs the decision on the same terms as the contract stamp and
  -- gates nothing either.

  --
  -- Five kinds of wrong, and each is stated as the fact rather than as a sentence
  -- — the page words them, because the wording is translated copy.
  --
  --   * `unassigned_count`  — active seats sitting in no group. A child enrolled
  --                           and nobody looking after them is the worst of these.
  --   * `groups_without_gedu` — a group with members and no educator assigned. An
  --                           EMPTY group is not flagged: an admin building the
  --                           term's groups ahead of time has not made a mistake.
  --   * `waitlist`          — people queueing while seats stand open AND those
  --                           seats have not all been offered to somebody. Only
  --                           meaningful on a capped product with the queue
  --                           switched on. NULL when there is nothing to say.
  --   * `missing_gedu_fee`  — NULL, not zero. Zero is a volunteer session, which
  --                           is a decision somebody made; NULL is a blank field.
  --                           The assistant fee is never flagged — NULL there
  --                           means "no assistant", which is the ordinary case.
  --   * `missing_municipality_fee` — municipality clubs only; the CHECK already
  --                           forbids the column elsewhere.
  --
  -- A product with none of them is not in the list at all.

COMMENT ON FUNCTION public.get_admin_dashboard() IS 'The whole admin dashboard in one document: per-role user counts (email-verified and, for gedus, certified — either can be NULL, where the stat has no meaning: certified only means something for an educator, and verified is NULL for a role none of whose accounts holds a real address, which is every gamer unless their parent chose sign-in mode email), the uncertified-gedu queue, live products carrying at least one ops issue, and the calendar facts the schedule and coming-up feed resolve weeks from. Admin-only, guard-first on assert_admin. Since 00201 each queue candidate also carries contract_accepted_at — when they accepted the current gedu contract, or NULL — which informs the certification decision without gating it; since 00202 that standing is judged on the version''s BASE, so either equally binding language of the current version counts, and a candidate holding both carries the earlier of the two signatures. Since 00213 each candidate additionally carries criminal_record_check_at — when an admin recorded seeing their criminal record extract, or NULL — which informs the same decision on the same terms and gates nothing either; the flag beside it is not shipped because the stamp is non-NULL exactly when the flag is true. Since 00207 the waitlist attention item asks whether there is something for an admin to DO rather than what state the product is in: an open seat that already carries a live seat offer is subtracted, so a product whose every open seat has been offered drops out of the queue, and a decline or an expiry raises it again on its own. The count rides in the emitted object as live_offer_count so the page can explain the absence. Both product sections ask effective_status() rather than products.status, and every date window is computed in the product''s own timezone. Product names are shipped as the whole product_translations array because which one to read is a property of the reader, exactly as every other admin surface treats them.';
