-- A product is delivered online, in person, or hybrid.
--
-- WHAT THIS CHANGES
--
-- 1. `products.is_remote` becomes `products.delivery_mode`, of the new enum
--    `public.delivery_mode`: true is online and false is in person. Hybrid is
--    the new third kind: gamers attend a site, and the gedu (and perhaps a few
--    gamers) joins through the Sogverse voice room. The column is NOT NULL with
--    no default, because an admin picks it on every product.
-- 2. The CHECKs and the location trigger are rewritten against it. Any product
--    that is not online needs a location, and that location is a site; only an
--    online product may hold a voice-room mode other than sogverse.
-- 3. create_product and update_product take p_delivery_mode in place of
--    p_is_remote.
-- 4. Every reader of the old flag asks one of three questions, now of the mode:
--    is there a voice room (online or hybrid), do gamers attend a site (in
--    person or hybrid), or does the gedu attend a site (in person alone). Every
--    document that carried the flag carries the mode, under `delivery_mode`
--    (`deliveryMode` in the admin feedback read, whose keys are camelCase).

CREATE TYPE public.delivery_mode AS ENUM (
  'online',
  'in_person',
  'hybrid'
);

COMMENT ON TYPE public.delivery_mode IS 'How a product is delivered. online: everybody joins through a voice room and there is no site — an online municipality club still carries a location, the municipality it serves, but no building. in_person: gamers and the gedu meet at a site, and there is no voice room. hybrid: gamers attend a site in person, and the gedu, with perhaps a few gamers, joins through the Sogverse voice room; everybody on the product, gamer, parent and gedu alike, is shown both the room and the site. A reader asks one of three questions of it: is there a voice room (online or hybrid), do gamers attend a site (in_person or hybrid, the two that require a site location), or does the gedu attend a site (in_person alone, which is why gedu_covers_product_site asks no coverage of a hybrid product).';

COMMENT ON FUNCTION public.gedu_assignment_summaries(p_gedu_id uuid, p_epoch_date date) IS 'One row per gedu assignment for the dashboard cards: group name, that group''s participant count (an active seat may be held by an adult as well as by a child), the venue name on in-person and hybrid products, and how many past sessions still need attention. A finished session on or after the epoch counts until ALL of: the register is in, a family-facing report is written, the mail telling the families it is there has been sent, and — on the run''s FINAL session of a product with requires_gamer_creations set — every current roster member has at least one creation. The register condition is scoped to the members who had JOINED the group before that occurrence ended: both the marks counted and the size they are compared against, off participations.group_joined_at against an end instant resolved once per occurrence (the stored row''s ends_at, else the planned end from derive_group_session_window, which is the same instant the "has it finished" test already used). group_participant_count deliberately keeps measuring the WHOLE current roster — a card''s headcount is not a per-occurrence question. The empty-group exemption is: an occurrence on which no member was expected owes nothing at all, so a group whose first members joined after its first sessions had run owes no register, report or mail for those sessions. The report and mail conditions are unscoped because a session owes those whoever was in the room. The creations condition carries the SAME join-date scoping as the register condition, on the owner''s principle that a gedu owes a creation for every gamer who was in the group at the time of the last session — so a seat placed into the group after the final session ended owes nothing, and one occurrence cannot answer "who was this for" two different ways. Only the JOIN half of that principle is expressible: a member who has since LEFT owes nothing, because the roster is active seats and a departure leaves no trace. The final session is group_final_session_date: the last planned date on or before end_date that the group has not cancelled, derived rather than stored — so a cancelled last session hands the creations condition to the one before it; an open-ended product (end_date NULL) has none and therefore never owes creations, which is documented behaviour rather than an error. A CANCELLED occurrence is never owed, by group_session_is_cancelled — including a cancelled record the schedule no longer projects, which the stored-row arm would otherwise reach: nothing ran, and a record kept under a cancellation is frozen. The badge''s unit is the SESSION: it counts sessions needing attention, and the final one simply has one more way to need it. The enforcement epoch travels in as an argument because it is a code constant, not a column. This count has a twin in TypeScript — the gedu feed''s entry-state derivation, which answers the same question for one card — and the two must be changed together, on all four conditions and on who a session is for, which scopes two of them. A SECOND KIND OF SEAT feeds the same machinery: a `substitution` row per substitution date, carrying `kind` and `substitution_date`, whose owed count is the same four conditions applied to a set of one occurrence — so it is 0 or 1 and never a term''s worth. That arm asks gedu_holds_unexpired_substitution rather than gedu_substitutes_session: the card stands from approval, where the workspace behind it opens 48 hours before the substituted session, and a card that waited for the workspace would hide from a sub the afternoon they had agreed to take. A substitution still locked owes nothing by construction, because every occurrence this count ranges over has already ended. A THIRD KIND, `trainee`: a row per gedu_group_trainees seat with substitution_date null, the group name, participant count and venue name like an assignment row, and an attention_count that is always 0 — what a session owes is the staff''s work, so no staff-only aggregate is computed for a trainee seat.';

COMMENT ON FUNCTION public.get_admin_product_sessions(p_product_id uuid) IS 'One round trip behind the admin product page''s Sessions panel: the product''s schedule parameters, its venue and site notes on an in-person or hybrid product, and every group on it with its standing notes, its register roster and every stored session row with a sparse attendance map and its photos. Admin-only, guard-first on assert_admin. Product-keyed rather than group-keyed because the page shows one product and puts a group selector in front of the feed; asking per group would send the product shell and the site over the wire once per group. Carries the product''s planned sessions beside its schedule parameters, as the gedu feed does: a top-level `planned_sessions` — the plan from start_date to the furthest of the groups'' session_plan_horizon (the product''s own when it has no groups), so every group''s next running session is inside (planned_sessions_document), plain {session_date, starts_at, ends_at} rows with no cancellation folded in, once for every group because the plan is the product''s — a top-level `holiday_breaks`, holiday_breaks_document over the same span (each break of a calendar the product follows, with its name in every locale and the plan rows it withdrew), and on each group its `final_session_date` (group_final_session_date), since each group''s cancellations can move it. A stored session row on a holiday date does not travel, and no group lists a cancellation on one: that date carries its break and nothing else. The SESSION shape is get_gedu_group_feed''s verbatim, because one card component renders both and the two must not disagree about what a session is — which is why `images` ({id, width, height} per photo, ordered by (created_at, id), never the uploader) arrives here in the same shape and needs no versioned name: this document''s reader shares the gedu session''s tolerant schema, and only the strict family one needed get_my_family_product_feed_v2. The ROSTER deliberately is not the gedu feed''s — it carries participant_id and first_name alone, since the only thing this surface does with it is take the register, and the groups panel on the same page already answers who these people are. Each group additionally carries `gedus` ({id, first_name, role}) and `substitutions` (every non-withdrawn substitution request on the group), both byte for byte get_gedu_group_feed''s — one card component renders the session cards of both documents, and the staffing line and the Set-a-sub / Clear-sub / Withdraw-request editor are drawn from exactly these two arrays. `reason` and `reason_note` DO travel here: this document is admin-only end to end, and the reason is what the editor shows beside the request.';

COMMENT ON FUNCTION public.get_admin_session_feedback(p_from date, p_to date, p_window_before_minutes integer) IS 'The admin feedback page''s whole read: every gamer''s feedback answer whose session day falls in [p_from, p_to], and every recorded session of an online or hybrid product in that range as the response rate''s denominator. Admin-only, guard-first on assert_admin; it crosses the boundary that session_feedback''s policies draw around each child''s own row. A row''s session day is its opening instant shifted forward by p_window_before_minutes, read in its product''s timezone — the caller passes the voice window constant so the number has one home. RESPONSES are gamers'' rows only, never an empty one (no answer and a blank note), and never filtered by whether the gamer still holds a seat: history is the point. Each carries its group and product, the respondent''s id and full name, every gedu expected at that (group, day) as decided by gedu_is_expected_at_session over the assigned gedus and the day''s seated substitutes (an assigned gedu keeps the assignment''s role; a substitute is ''substitute''), the stored answers verbatim with retired keys included, the note, the last save as submittedAt, and countsTowardRate: true exactly when a non-cancelled group_sessions row exists for that (group, day) and its session_attendance marks the respondent present, so the response rate reads "of the gamers marked present, how many answered" and can never pass 100%. SESSIONS are group_sessions rows on online and hybrid products, the ones with a voice room, in the range, cancelled ones left out, each with the count of gamers marked present and the same expected gedus; a session nobody was marked present at still travels. A response whose session has no recorded row travels without a partner in sessions. Every entry carries all of its product''s name translations, and the reader picks one by locale. Keys are camelCase in the shape the page''s contract parses.';

COMMENT ON FUNCTION public.get_gedu_group_feed(p_group_id uuid) IS 'One round trip for a group workspace: product shell (with the gedu-only material link, read from product_staff_details), group notes, site notes on in-person and hybrid products, the current roster, and every stored session row with its sparse attendance map and its photos — except a row on a holiday date, which carries its break and nothing else. Carries the product''s planned sessions beside its schedule parameters: `planned_sessions`, the plan from start_date to this group''s session_plan_horizon (planned_sessions_document), so the group''s next running session is inside however many dates ahead of it the group cancelled, as plain {session_date, starts_at, ends_at} rows with no cancellation folded in; `holiday_breaks`, holiday_breaks_document over the same span — each break of a calendar the product follows, with its name in every locale and the plan rows it withdrew; and `final_session_date`, this group''s group_final_session_date — NULL on an open-ended product. `cancellations` lists the cancellations in effect, none on a holiday date. Open to an ADMIN as well as to the assigned gedu, guard-first on assert_role with the ownership question as a second 42501 — the same shape set_group_notes uses. The admin caller is the product page''s per-group GROUP DETAILS page, which renders the gedu workspace''s page body unchanged: one body fed by one document is what keeps the two surfaces one surface, where a second admin-shaped RPC would have started drifting field by field. An admin passes the ownership half outright; a gedu is shown only their OWN group''s feed, and a customer or a gamer is refused on the first statement, which is what keeps the material link and the three staff notes off every family surface. Each roster row is keyed by participant_id (whoever holds the seat, child or adult), carries both game identities (minecraft_username/minecraft_uuid and roblox_username/roblox_user_id, independent of each other and drawn according to the product''s topic, which this document does not carry), and carries two contact fields and never both: parent_email for a child (their linked parent), participant_email for an adult seat (their own address, NULL on child rows because a gamer profile''s email is a synthetic non-mailbox). Each roster row also carries the staff-only flair — group_joined_at (when the seat entered THIS group, as against signed_up_at, which is when it was taken on the product), note and note_updated_by_first_name — in deliberate parity with get_gedu_assigned_product''s roster, which is the parity the page depends on because it renders this copy. Each roster row additionally carries `creations` (always an array, [] when there is no row) — the one roster field that is NOT staff-only, since the member''s own family reads the same list — and the product shell carries requires_gamer_creations, because the final session''s fourth completeness condition is derived on the CLIENT from that flag, the schedule and this roster''s creations; no document carries an "owed" field. Each session row carries report_emailed_at — when its report was mailed to the families, NULL until it was — and never report_emailed_by, which is audit and renders nowhere. Each session row also carries `images`: {id, width, height} per photo, ordered by (created_at, id), with the uploader deliberately off the wire for the same reason the sender is. The key sits directly on the session rather than under a versioned name, because the gedu contracts schema is tolerant of unknown keys. The document carries two more members, both of them inputs to the client-side staffing derivation rather than answers from it: `gedus`, the group''s assignments as {id, first_name, role}; and `substitutions`, every NON-WITHDRAWN substitution request on the group, unbounded, in the one shape substitution_request_document defines and every substitution write returns. Withdrawn is the one status that does not travel, because it changes nothing about who is expected. The client merges substitutions onto its entries by date, and a projected date with no session row carries its requests like any other. `reason` and `reason_note` ride for an ADMIN caller only — this document is served to an admin too, so the flag is the CALLER''s role rather than a property of the RPC, which is what keeps a `sick` category off a colleague''s screen while the one document stays one document. `offer_count` rides for an admin and for the requester themselves. The GATE is gedu_teaches_group, which admits a live substitution on the group, so a sub opens the workspace they are substituting. It is the ONE caller that asks substitution_request_document to reveal the requester explicitly. The workspace is reached only by staff on the group and its session card''s staffing line names who is away; the REASON rides on the admin flag alone, so a colleague learns that somebody is absent and never that it was `sick`. `trainees` names the group''s trainee seats as {id, first_name} in placement order, drawn as Trainee-marked chips after the group''s gedus on every workspace shell; a trainee is not in `gedus`, and a trainee cannot read this document — gedu_teaches_group has no trainee arm, and their own read is get_trainee_group_feed.';

COMMENT ON FUNCTION public.get_my_family_product_feed(p_participation_id uuid) IS 'One round trip for a family club/camp/event page, scoped to ONE participation: the product shell, the group name and its family-facing note, the venue on in-person and hybrid products, the teaching gedus'' first names, the group''s full stored session history with reports and PHOTOS, the named participant''s own attendance marks, and that participant''s own creations. Each session carries updated_by and the last editor''s first name — last editor of the SESSION, not author of the report: an attendance mark or a staff-note edit moves it. The name travels per session because a past session''s editor may no longer teach the group. Each session also carries `images`: {id, width, height} per photo, ordered by (created_at, id), the same shape the gedu and admin documents carry because one shared gallery renders all three, and never the uploader, which is safeguarding audit. That key rides on this strict family document under no versioned twin of its own, on the severity paragraph in docs/plans/CLAUDE.md: transient read-side breakage inside a release window is accepted. `creations` is a TOP-LEVEL array of {title, url} — this participant''s own, in this group, and structurally incapable of holding anybody else''s because it is not a map keyed by participant. It is the one staff-authored family-facing field that carries links, an owner-approved exception to the link-free rule session reports follow, and the render side parses each URL and degrades to the title as plain text when it is not http(s). Empty array when there is nothing, so the card renders on emptiness and never on null. `planned_sessions` is the product''s plan from start_date to session_plan_horizon for this group (planned_sessions_document), raised to the product-local date a `canceling` subscription''s current_period_end falls on — the paid-through instant the page clamps the list at — as plain {session_date, starts_at, ends_at} rows; the cancellations stay their own list, and leave out any on a holiday date. `holiday_breaks` is holiday_breaks_document over the same span: each break of a calendar the product follows, with its name in every locale and the plan rows it withdrew. Self-scoping — the caller must be the participation''s participant (a child, or a parent holding a seat of their own) or a parent linked to them; an unplaced participation has no page and answers P0002; a row that does not exist and a row belonging to another family are refused identically, so it cannot be used as an oracle for enrollment ids. Carries no gedu note of any scope, no roster, no other participant''s marks or creations, no parent email, no material link, no requires_gamer_creations flag and no owed/completeness state.';

It takes NO status: a product''s lifecycle is derived from its dates, so there is nothing for a creating caller to choose and nothing stored for a later reader to mistake for a fact. p_start_date is defaulted like every other optional argument, but the column behind it is NOT NULL — an omitting caller is refused by the column rather than creating a product with no day it begins. SECURITY INVOKER — the assert_admin() first statement runs as the caller, which is also why assert_admin itself is granted to authenticated. p_for_gamers/p_for_parents are non-defaulted on purpose: a defaulted audience is one an omitting caller could set without meaning to. p_tag IS defaulted, and for the opposite reason: null is a legal value for a tag, no CHECK backstops it, and codegen cannot express an explicit null for a non-defaulted argument at all — so omission is how "untagged" reaches the column, and the required-nullable wire schema is what stops an accidental omission upstream. p_region_lock_country is defaulted for exactly that reason too, and carries one more thing worth knowing: the lock it writes is enforced in the UI alone, because a family''s location is self-attested — see the column comment. p_required_consent_slugs is defaulted on the same argument and is NOT written inline: this function is SECURITY INVOKER and product_required_consents carries no write grant, so the row goes through set_product_required_consents, the join table''s single guarded writer. p_requires_gamer_creations is defaulted to FALSE rather than to null, because the column is NOT NULL and false is the resting state of that whole feature — so an omitting caller creates an unflagged product, which is what omission should mean, and an explicit null is refused loudly by the column rather than silently becoming false. p_invoice_customer_id is defaulted on the same argument as p_tag — null is legal, nothing backstops its absence, and codegen cannot express an explicit null — and names the FENNOA CUSTOMER a municipality club is invoiced to; it is per club and never derived from a location, and chk_products_invoice_customer_only_for_muni refuses one on any other product type. This function does NOT take a picture: a product''s picture is the catalogue_images entry its image_id points at, written by the route in a second statement, and the served image_path column is derived from that link by trg_products_apply_image_path. p_spoken_language_code is public.spoken_language, an enum rather than a text key into a reference table. p_holiday_calendar_ids names the holiday calendars a club follows and is NOT written inline either: it goes through set_product_holiday_calendars, product_holiday_calendars'' single guarded writer, which refuses a non-empty set on a product that is not a club. NULL, the default, follows none. p_voice_room_mode and p_external_voice_url say how an online product''s sessions are joined: a Sogverse voice room (the default), an outside link, or no room at all, in which case each translation may carry voice_join_instructions. The CHECKs on products refuse a link on any mode but external and anything but a Sogverse room on a product that is not online; the rule that crosses into the translations is this function''s own, enforced after they are written: mode none needs instructions in at least one translation, and instructions on any translation need mode none. p_voice_room_mode defaults to ''sogverse'' for the reason p_requires_gamer_creations defaults to false: the column is NOT NULL and that is its resting state. p_delivery_mode — online, in_person or hybrid — is non-defaulted on purpose, like the audience: there is no resting state to fall back on, so an admin always chooses it. A product that is not online needs a site location, and only an online one may leave the Sogverse room, both enforced by the CHECKs and validate_products_location rather than here.';

  -- The voice room pair is `requires_gamer_creations`' shape: the mode's

Deletion rather than promotion: promoting would grant seats with no subscription behind them, while the edit itself opens seats, so a dropped family can simply sign up again. It is silent by owner decision — no confirmation, warning or email — and keyed to the flag''s value rather than to it changing, so a queue left stranded on a product whose waitlist is already off is cleared by the next save. One exception: a waitlisted row carrying a LIVE subscription (a family_subscriptions row with status <> ''cancelled'') is skipped, because the FK cascades and deleting it would orphan billing Stripe still runs. SECURITY DEFINER — participations grants authenticated no writes, so the delete cannot run as the caller; the assert_admin() first statement is what authorizes the whole function. It assigns for_gamers/for_parents, which are non-defaulted parameters precisely because this statement assigns every editable column on every call. It also assigns tag, whose parameter IS defaulted — null is a legal tag and no CHECK backstops it, so omission is the only expressible way to clear one, and the required-nullable wire schema is what keeps that deliberate. It assigns region_lock_country the same way, and that column is deliberately editable on a live product: the lock gates future enrolments only, is never re-run against a seat already held, and is enforced in the UI alone because a family''s location is self-attested. start_date is the one editable column omission CANNOT clear: it is NOT NULL, so an omitting caller is refused by the column rather than quietly blanking the date on a live product. It does NOT assign image_path and takes no p_image_path: that column is derived from image_id by trg_products_apply_image_path on this very UPDATE, so an assignment here would be overwritten a moment later. p_spoken_language_code is public.spoken_language, an enum rather than a text key into a reference table. p_required_consent_slugs replaces the requirement set through set_product_required_consents — NULL clears it, and past acceptances are never touched, because dropping a requirement changes what future enrolments must agree to and says nothing about what past ones did. It assigns requires_gamer_creations, whose parameter defaults FALSE rather than null because the column is NOT NULL — so an omitting caller unflags the product, the same "omission clears it" semantics tag has, kept deliberate by the required wire field. It assigns invoice_customer_id, the FENNOA CUSTOMER a municipality club is invoiced to — tag''s shape exactly, a defaulted parameter whose omission clears the link, kept deliberate by a required-nullable wire field, and editable for the club''s whole life because who buys a club can change between terms. It is per club and never derived from a location, and chk_products_invoice_customer_only_for_muni refuses one on any other product type. p_holiday_calendar_ids replaces the set of holiday calendars the club follows through set_product_holiday_calendars — NULL clears it, the shape p_required_consent_slugs has, kept deliberate by a required wire field. The plan follows at once, past months included. It assigns voice_room_mode and external_voice_url on every call: the mode''s parameter defaults to ''sogverse'' and the link''s to null, so an omitting caller resets the product to a Sogverse room with no link, the same "omission clears it" semantics tag has, kept deliberate by required wire fields. Each translation''s voice_join_instructions is replaced with the rest of the translation, and once the set is in place the function refuses mode none with instructions in no translation, and instructions on any translation under another mode — a rule across two tables, so it lives here rather than in a CHECK. It assigns delivery_mode from p_delivery_mode, which is non-defaulted because the column has no resting state for an omitting caller to fall back on; the CHECKs and validate_products_location hold the location and voice-room rules that follow from the mode.';
