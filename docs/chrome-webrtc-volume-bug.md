# Chrome WebRTC Volume Amplification Bug

## Problem

We cannot amplify remote WebRTC audio above 100% in Chrome. The volume slider works for 0–100% via `HTMLAudioElement.volume`, but amplification beyond 100% is not possible with any approach we've found.

## Decision

We capped the volume slider at 10–100%. The 0–100% range via `element.volume` is reliable across all browsers. Amplification above 100% is not achievable in Chrome for WebRTC MediaStream sources without significant trade-offs. See "Approaches investigated" below for the full analysis.

## Current implementation

Two independent pipelines per remote participant:

```
Playback:  <audio element>.srcObject = MediaStream([persistentTrack])
Analysis:  createMediaStreamSource(MediaStream([persistentTrack])) → AnalyserNode
```

- `element.volume` handles everything audible: volume control (10–100%) AND zone muting (set to 0)
- The `<audio>` element is **not** connected to the Web Audio graph — no `createMediaElementSource`
- A separate `createMediaStreamSource` from the same track feeds the `AnalyserNode` for speaking-glow visualization
- The `AnalyserNode` is **not** connected to `ctx.destination` — same pattern as the local mic analyser

**Why NOT use `createMediaElementSource`:** When `createMediaElementSource` is used on a MediaStream-backed element, Chrome doesn't reliably route audio data through the Web Audio graph — the AnalyserNode receives silence even though the element plays audio fine. This broke the speaking glow indicator. Using `createMediaStreamSource` with an independent MediaStream from the same track gives the AnalyserNode reliable data without interfering with the element's playback or volume control.

**Why NOT connect analyser to `ctx.destination`:** Approaches 1 and 2 below show that routing `createMediaStreamSource` to `ctx.destination` kills all WebRTC audio in Chrome. Leaving the analyser disconnected from the destination avoids this. Chrome's `MediaStreamAudioSourceNode` is a push source that feeds connected nodes regardless of destination — the AnalyserNode processes data without needing a pull from `ctx.destination`.

## Approaches investigated

### 1. `createMediaStreamSource` → GainNode → `ctx.destination`

**Result: No audio.** Chrome kills all WebRTC audio when routing a `MediaStreamAudioSourceNode` to `ctx.destination`. The AnalyserNode still receives data (speaking glow works) but no sound reaches the speakers. This is a [documented Chrome bug](https://blog.twoseven.xyz/chrome-webrtc-remote-volume/) — routing WebRTC streams through the Web Audio graph disrupts Chrome's internal audio pipeline.

### 2. `createMediaStreamSource` → GainNode → `createMediaStreamDestination` → `<audio>`

**Result: No audio.** Based on the [otalk/mediastream-gain](https://github.com/otalk/mediastream-gain) pattern. Chrome's WebRTC audio disruption still occurs even when routing to `createMediaStreamDestination` instead of `ctx.destination`.

### 3. `createMediaElementSource(element)` → GainNode → `ctx.destination`

**Result: Audio plays, but GainNode amplification above 1.0 has no effect.** Chrome bypasses Web Audio graph gain when `createMediaElementSource` is used on an element whose `srcObject` is a MediaStream (as opposed to a `src` URL). `element.volume` (0–1) still works because it's applied outside the Web Audio graph.

**Additional problem: AnalyserNode gets silence.** When volume control was moved to `element.volume` and the GainNode was removed, the AnalyserNode stopped receiving data. Chrome doesn't reliably route MediaStream-backed element audio through the `MediaElementAudioSourceNode` — the speaking glow broke. This led to the current approach of using a separate `createMediaStreamSource` for analysis.

Volume boost browser extensions use `createMediaElementSource` on elements with `src` URLs (file/streaming playback), which does allow GainNode amplification — but that doesn't apply to WebRTC MediaStream sources.

### 4. Insertable Streams (`MediaStreamTrackProcessor`)

**Result: Broken for inbound WebRTC audio in Chrome.** `MediaStreamTrackProcessor` can process outbound audio (e.g., mic → filter → send), but for inbound WebRTC tracks the transform callback never executes and no audio plays. This is filed as [Chromium bug #1264539](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/40184923) and a [WebRTC samples issue](https://github.com/webrtc/samples/issues/1488), with no fix as of March 2026.

### 5. Sender-side gain (TwoSeven's solution)

**Result: Works, but incompatible with SFU architecture.** [TwoSeven](https://blog.twoseven.xyz/chrome-webrtc-remote-volume/) solved this by applying gain on the sender side — the receiver requests a volume level, and the sender adjusts their GainNode per peer connection. This works because TwoSeven uses mesh (peer-to-peer) topology where each sender has a separate `RTCPeerConnection` per receiver.

Daily.co uses an SFU (Selective Forwarding Unit): each sender sends **one** audio track to the server, which forwards it to all receivers. There's no way to apply different gain per receiver. If User A wants User B louder and User C wants User B quieter, the SFU can't satisfy both.

### 6. Uniform sender-side pre-amplification

**Result: Feasible but trade-offs outweigh benefit.** Each sender would process their mic through a GainNode (e.g., 1.5x) before sending via `updateInputSettings({ audio: { customTrack } })`. Receivers use `element.volume` (0–1.0) to scale 0% to ~150%.

Problems:
- **AGC interference:** Chrome's WebRTC Automatic Gain Control may normalize the boosted signal back down, defeating the purpose. Disabling AGC (`autoGainControl: false`) means losing automatic level normalization for all users.
- **Clipping on loud peaks:** Typical speech peaks at -12 to -6 dBFS after AGC. A 2x boost (+6 dB) pushes peaks to -6 to 0 dBFS — borderline clipping. Shouting or plosives would clip, and that distortion is baked into the Opus-encoded stream (can't be undone by the receiver).
- **Noise floor doubled:** Background noise (fans, typing, hiss) is amplified equally.
- **No per-listener independence:** Everyone hears the same boosted signal.

### 7. AudioWorklet processor

**Not tested.** A custom `AudioWorkletNode` that multiplies samples directly. Might bypass Chrome's restriction since it processes raw PCM data. However, the AudioWorklet would need to receive audio via `createMediaStreamSource` or `createMediaElementSource` — the same entry points that have the Chrome limitations documented above. Likely subject to the same restrictions.

### 8. Multiple `<audio>` elements (same stream)

**Not tested, probably won't work.** Playing the same MediaStream through two `<audio>` elements to get 2x volume via browser audio mixing. No documentation exists confirming this works. Chrome's internal WebRTC audio mixer handles all tracks as a single stream, so duplicate elements may not produce independent audio outputs. Phase alignment issues could cause constructive/destructive interference rather than clean amplification.

### 9. Firefox / Safari behavior

**Not tested.** Firefox and Safari may handle `createMediaStreamSource` differently and allow GainNode amplification. Could implement browser-specific code paths, but adds complexity and testing burden.
